I am writing this file from within the notebook. 

I can write whatever I want and it will be written to a text file in the specified folder. 

If I don't write a filepath, this text file will be written into the home directory of the notebook.

Note that the '~' indicates my HOME directory - it can replace /Users/myang/, which is the home directory of my computer.
