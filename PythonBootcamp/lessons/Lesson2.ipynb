This is a nice way of composing a string of other strings, but its a downright blessing when you want to compose a string including number values. In the case of numbers, you can always supply them to strings with %s elements (like we just did with string variables), but there are also special interpolation operators for numbers %d, %i and %f (corresponding to digits, integers and floating point, respectively). For a full workup, see [here](http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html).\n",
