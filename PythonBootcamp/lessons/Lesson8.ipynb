    "\n",
    "We do so because the types of software you encounter might be easier to use in one language or another. For instance, many software are actually written such that you can call the software from the Terminal using a number of options. Thus, without a GUI developed for the software, you might not know how to install or use the software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, there might be a package of library that easily does everything you want. **R** is very handy for some default figures, as well as for phylogenetic analysis, and though modules like **DendroPy** might mean you can do equivalent analyses in Python, the history of using **R** means that other people's old code/packages you might want to use are in **R**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you might want to take one set of data, use Python to set up the initial data format, call a software from the Terminal to analyze said data, and then use Python to process the returned results and place the results in a figure. Doing each part separately means that you have to manually go from Python to software, and then software back to Python. Wouldn't it be easier if you could write a single script all in Python, and not have to watch your steps? You can!\n",

    "The **subprocess** module allows us to be a bit more intelligent about how we execute system calls by using a method called **subprocess.Popen()**.

We've seen most of the original functionality of the language, which was originally intended for scripting of UNIX and web processes, and writing user interfaces. But as Python became popular as a scripting language, it found its way into the arms of scientists, who generally speaking, care more about efficient data manipulation than web programming. *The big piece that was missing in Python was a numerical library, which means a collection of tools for dealing with large amounts of numbers at once.* After a few efforts, an integrated one was developed. Numerical Python, or NumPy provided a large collection of mathematical functions similar to those found in a language like MATLAB or R, and also similarly to those languages, provides datatypes that are manipulatable as vectors and matrices. We'll introduce these data types, then their associated functions."

    "## NumPy Basics\n",
    "Numerical Python is a powerful library of functions, methods, and data types we can used to analyze our data. Unforunately for those of us whose heads continue to spin in a crash-course of syntax, it also uses a different set of rules. I hope you'll understand why when you see the power and speed NumPy's data types afford us. Let's start off creating some empty arrays, which look sorta like **lists**, and are in fact **vectors** or **arrays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "They differ in a few fundamental ways from lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrays cannot be of mixed types. They can be all integers, floats, strings, logical (or boolean) values, or other immutable values. But they cannot be some characters, some numbers, or any other mixture of data types. They also cannot contain mutable types such as lists. So, we can have a list of lists, but not an array of lists. We can, however, have an array of arrays (sortof). Which brings us to:\n",
    "2. Arrays can be multidimensional, but they must be rectangular. You can have a list of lists, where the first interior list is 3 elements long, the second 5, and the third 12, but your multidimensional array must be expressible as \"a m by n (by j by k by...) array\". I have never encountered a situation where Python says there are too many dimensions (but I've never had need beyond, maybe, 4 dimensions).\n",
    "3. We can perform vector operations on them, which can be algebraic functions (like a dot product), or simple replacements of values in slice of the array.\n",

    "The [stats](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) module of SciPy has functions for even more statistical distributions, statistical tests, and other assorted functions that a good statistician might need. As an example, let's see how we might use the [linregress](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html#scipy.stats.linregress) function, which does a linear regression on some data. Linear regression is the process of finding a line that minimizes the sum of the square of the vertical distances from each point to the line.\n",
