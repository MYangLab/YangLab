That way, you can search up whatever module you need and install it. We will install [**BioPython**](http://biopython.org/), a module with many functions for reading and parsing sequence data, and [**msprime**](https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a library that simulates genetic data using coalescent theory.

(Although, sometimes, re-inventing the wheel can be a useful teaching exercise...). Today, we'll be exploring the **Biopython** module. Biopython is a package with a collection of useful tools for bioinformatics. It can do things like parse sequence files in a variety of different formats (.fasta, .fastq, clustal alignment files, ExPASy files, Swiss Prot, etc), provide code to manipulate sequences (for example, perform transcription, translation, or reverse-complement), and interface with many useful databases on NCBI (Entrez, Pubmed, Blast).\n",
