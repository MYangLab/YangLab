    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This afternoon we'll concentrate on our last fundamental programming concept for the course. To date, we've been writing all of our program logic in the main body of our scripts. And we've seen how built-in python __functions__ like __raw_input()__ are used to operate on variables and their values. In this session, we'll learn how to write __functions__ of our own, how to properly document them for ourselves and other users, and how to collect them into __modules__, and make our own local repositories, or __libraries__.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you properly leverage a well-designed function, writing the main logic of your programs becomes almost-too-easy. Instead of writing out meticulous logical statements and loops for every task, you just call forth your previously-crafted logic, which you've vested in well-made __functions__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are the basic means to manage complexity in your programs, allowing you to avoid nesting and repeating large chunks of code that could otherwise make your tasks unmanageable. They allow you to bundle code with a defined input and output into single lines, and you should use them frequently from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello(name):\n",
    " greeting = \"Hello %s!\" % (name)\n",
    " return greeting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a function, you use the keyword __def__. Then comes the function name, in this case __hello__, with parentheses containing any input __arguments__ the function might need. In this case, we need a name to form a proper greeting, so we're giving the __hello()__ function a variable __argument__ called __name__. After that, the function does its thing, executing the indented block of code immediately below. In this case, it creates a greeting _Hello \"name\"!_. The last thing that it does is return that greeting to the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created, you call on the function as your normally would:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myinput = \"class\"\n",
    "myoutput = hello(myinput)\n",
    "\n",
    "print myoutput\n",
    "\n",
    ">> 'Hello class!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically speaking, a function does not need to explicitly return something, although it's uncommon that you'll write any that don't. If you don't return something explicitly, Python will nevertheless return the special object None. None is logically false (for if statements), and printing None will result in nothing being printed (although None is not the empty string). It's easy to forget to return a value, so this is an easy first thing to check in case your functions don't work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello(name):\n",
    " greeting = \"Hello %s!\" % (name)\n",
    " ##return greeting\n",
    "\n",
    "myinput = \"class\"\n",
    "myoutput = hello(myinput)\n",
    "\n",
    "print myoutput\n",

    "print 'Outside of the function:', testVariable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the epic story of a bachelor party gone horrifically awry was assigned to a variable called __testVariable__ inside the function, nothing happened to that variable outside the function. Variables created inside a function occupy their own __namespace__ in memory distinct from variables outside of the function, and so reusing names between the two can be done without you having to keep track of it. (Refer to the article http://bytebaker.com/2008/07/30/python-namespaces/ about __namespace__ for more information.) That means you can use functions written by other people without having to keep track of what variables those functions are using internally. Just like a sleazy town in Nevada, what happens in the function stays in the function. (An important exception lies with lists and dictionaries, which you will examine in the exercises.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What happens if you try to print **testVariable** outside of the function and you don't assign anything to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you have learned to write in python so far can go into a function -- they are a means of organizing your code, and are best used after you write a series of commands you expect to often use. Turning that series of commands into a function makes it easy to repeat that set of commands over and over, while keeping the code easy to read. "

    "So how do functions make our lives easier? We can exploit functions to break difficult tasks into a number of easier tasks, and then these easier tasks into ones easier still, and so on. Large code blocks, with a few function calls, are only tens of lines long, and many functions are only a handful of lines. This allows us to program in large, structural sweeps, rather than getting lost in the details. This makes programs both easier to write and easier to read:\n",

    "In all of the examples above, we defined our functions right above the code that we hoped to execute. If you have many functions, you can see how this would get messy in a hurry. Furthermore, part of the benefit of functions is that you can call them multiple times within a program to execute the same operations without tiresomely writing them all out again. But wouldn't it be nice to share functions across programs, too? For example, working with genomic data means lots of time getting sequence out of FASTA files, and shuttling that sequence from program to program. Many of the programs we work with overlap to a significant degree, as they need to parse FASTA files, calculate evolutionary rates, and interface with our lab servers, for example -- all of which means that many of them share functions. And if the same function exists in two or more different programs, we hit the same problems that we hit before: complex debugging, decreased readability, and, of course, too much typing.\n",

If you want to import a whole module, but don't want to type out it's full name every time, you can use the syntax: __import a_long_module_name as mname__.\n",

    "Over time, you'll end up accumulating lots of these modules, and they'll tend to fall together in meaningful collections. For example, you might have a module for all your functions related to reading and parsing files, called *files_tools.py*. You might have another for common sequence-related tasks, called *sequence_tools.py*. Python keeps its modules installed in a system directory that you may or may not have access to on a remote server. Therefore, it's useful and simpler to just create your own python modules directory and then let your operating system environment know about it. \n",

The pylib folder can be placed anywhere, but keep in mind what is the path to the directory and whether this is a convenient place to keep the modules. Then, you can set up a command in the hidden file *.bash_profile* in the home directory. \n",

    "NOTE: *.bash_profile* vs. _.bashrc_: In Linux, *.bash_profile* is run upon login while _.bashrc_ is run each time a new terminal is open. Thus, __if you are using Linux and it isn't working__, try inputting the following commands and see if it works. [This link](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html) gives a pretty good summary of the difference in the two hidden files.\n",
