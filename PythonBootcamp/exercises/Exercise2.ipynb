    "## Exercise 2.1: The Greeter\n",
    "A. Write a program that asks for the user's name and tells them hello. Try it first in a cell but then write it to a file and execute it in the Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Add on to the script, making it ask for your year of birth. Make the script compute your age and print it in the following format: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Since you were born in 1988, your age is 28.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.2: Numbers, numbers everywhere\n",
    "A. Take Exercise 1.8 and re-write it so that the two numbers are inputted into the program rather than directly set to a variable. Have it print the fraction and decimal to screen as normal. Figure out how to make this program fail - how many can you come up with?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Write a script where you read five numbers in. Print out their sum and mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Enter two numbers and store these in two variables called **input1** and **input2**. Swap the values of the two variables so **input1** and **input2** switch values. However, do this in only one line of code and without introducing new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. CHALLENGE: First, ask the user to specify a number of digits (e.g. 1-digit numbers, 2-digit numbers, etc.). Then, Ask the user to supply five numbers of that many digits separated by spaces. Parse these numbers out, and calculate sum and mean as in Exercise 2.2B. Try doing this without using any additional variables! (Use only the one that contains the string that you read in.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.3: Crazy strings\n",
    "Reproduce the triple-quoted string from earlier\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = '''hello \"world\", if that is your real name. \n",
    "That's World, to you'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "in just one string using single or double quotes. Make sure you have the line break and all the quotes and apostrophes in there!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.4: New Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "L = [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]\n",
    "print L, L[:], L[:0], L[-2], L[-2:]\n",
    "L.reverse()\n",
    "print L\n",
    "L.sort()\n",
    "print L\n",
    "idx = L.index(4)\n",

    "print {'a':1, 'b':2}['b']\n",
    "D = {'x':1, 'y':2, 'z':3}\n",
    "D['w'] = 0\n",
    "print D['x'] + D['w']\n",
    "print D.keys(), D.values(), D.has_key('z')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Add comments detailing what each line in the script above is doing. Then run these commands and make sure you are correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.5: Meet your classmates!\n",
    "Take a moment to learn the names of your fellow classmates! Make a list (called **students**) containing their names (include at least five names in the list). \n",
    "\n",
    "A. What happens when you try to index out of bounds (eg. __students[15]__)?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. What about slicing out of bounds (eg. __students[-100:100]__, __students[30:50]__, __students[2:10]__)?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. What happens when you try to extract a sequence in reverse--with the lower bound greater than the higher bound (e.g. __students[3:1]__)? What happens when you try assigning __students[3:1] = ['?']__? \n",
    "\n",
    "D. Add your own name to the middle of the list of TAs by indexing, then add your teacher's name to the list by using the __insert()__ method that we discussed in class. See what happens if you use indexing to add the string 'AHHH' to the list using the index __[3:5]__ or __[4:2]__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.6: Slicing\n",
    "A. Set a variable **x** to the string \"I am a major python enthusiast.\" Apply the function **list**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = list(x)\n",
    "print y\n",
    "```\n",
    "What happens to the string?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Set the outcome to a new variable **y**\n",

    "print '8', y[1:4:2]\n",
    "print '9', y[::-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "What happens in each of the cases above?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Take this list of numbers: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylst = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using slicing, print a list of only even numbers, only odd numbers, and only numbers divisible by four. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.7: Make some friends\n",
    "For each of your classmates, ask what is their favorite food, activity and book, as well as the month they were born.  Since you want to get to know them, create a dictionary to store this information, making their names keys and their favorites list values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A. What happens if you try to index a non-existent key (e.g. __print D['Terry']__)?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. What happens if you try to assign to a non-existent key (e.g. __D['Terry'] = '?'__)?\n",
    "\n",
    "C. How does this compare to out-of-bound assignments for lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Print the names of any classmates with a birthday in July. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.8: Sets, sets, sets!\n",
    "This lesson, you learned about many ways to group data. Here is one more, Sets!  Like a set in mathematics, it has a bunch of elements with no repeats.  To build a set, you pass in a list, and it will automatically remove duplicates.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myset = set([1,1,2,3,5,8])\n",
    "\n",
    "set([8, 1, 2, 3, 5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Google \"python Sets\" and see if you can learn a bit more about them. They have many methods and we will learn a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following two sets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "beijing_unis = {\"Beida\",\"CAS\",\"Qinghua\",\"Renmin\"}\n",
    "china_unis = {\"Beida\",\"CAS\",\"Qinghua\",\"Renmin\",\"Jilin\",\"Fudan\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Can you figure out how to get the union of these two sets? The intersection? The Chinese universities that are not in Beijing? Look up the methods associated with Sets, and consider using the **??** option when using Jupyter notebooks to see details on different methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2.9: Pulling it all together (Challenge!)\n",
    "Your boss has asked you to do a small bioinformatics project on LeuT (pdb code 2Q6H), which is the neurotransmitter responsible for transporting antidepressants. To help you out, I am providing a script (see below) that will read in a file and save the protein sequence to a list called protSeq. I have commented the code, but there are many things in here you haven't learned yet.\n",
    "HINT: Protein Databank (PDB) structure files are stored at http://www.rcsb.org/. Use the pdb code to find the structure. The structure file can be downloaded from Download Files >> PDB File (text). __The structure file must be in the same directory as the script for the script to run properly.__\n",
    "\n",
    "So, copy the code below into a file, and then you can access the list of all amino acids stored as the list variable __protSeq__. You can start by printing this variable and proving to yourself that the list contains the information you think it does. Then add to the code to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. How many total amino acids are in the protein?\n",
    "B. Print out total count of each amino acid in alphabetical order.\n",
    "C. Can you do part B with **sets** instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided script:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#initialize list to store sequence\n",
    "protSeq = []\n",
    "#open pdb file\n",
    "f1 = open('2q6h.pdb', 'r')\n",
    "#loop over lines in file\n",
    "for next in f1:\n",
    "    #identify lines that contain sequences\n",
    "    if next[:6] == 'SEQRES':\n",
    "        #strip away white space and\n",
    "        #convert line into list\n",
    "        line = next.strip().split()\n",
    "        #delete descriptor information\n",
    "        #at beginning of each line\n",
    "        del line[:4]\n",
    "        #loop over amino acids in line\n",
    "        for aa in line:\n",
    "            #add to sequence list\n",
    "            protSeq.append(aa)\n",
